<p>Are we even surprised? By now we already know the air fryer is supreme. The fact that crispy golden chicken can be achieved without the use of any oil whatsoever is amazing and that's not to mention how quickly the air fryer can do it! There's no need to turn on your oven or make a whole oily mess on your stovetop: This chicken parm tastes every bit as good as the traditional version with much less effort to get there. </p>
<h2>Ingrediants</h2>
<ul>
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts
   
</ul>
<ul>Kosher salt
    </ul>
   <ul> Freshly ground black pepper
    </ul>
   <ul>1/3 c. all-purpose flour
    </ul>
    <ul>2 large eggs
        </ul>
   <ul>1 c. panko bread crumbs
    </ul>
    <ul>1/4 c. freshly grated Parmesan
    </ul>
    <ul>1 tsp. dried oregano
    </ul>
  <ul>1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes 
    </ul>
    <ul>1/2 tsp. garlic powder
    </ul>
     <ul>1 c. marinara
    </ul>
    <ul>1 c. shredded mozzarella 
    </ul>
     <ul>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>Carefully butterfly chicken by cutting in half widthwise all the way through to create 4 thin pieces of chicken; season both sides with salt and black pepper.
    </li>
      <li>Place flour in a shallow bowl; season with a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. In another shallow bowl, beat eggs to blend. In a third shallow bowl, combine panko, Parmesan, oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder.
</li>
<li>Working one at a time, coat chicken in flour, shaking off any excess. Dip into eggs, letting excess drip off, then finally dip into panko mixture, gently pressing to adhere and ensuring both sides of chicken are well coated.
    </li>
   <li>Working in batches if necessary, in an air-fryer basket, arrange chicken in a single layer. Cook at 400°, turning once, for 5 minutes per side. Top chicken with marinara and mozzarella. Continue to cook at 400° until cheese is melted and golden, about 3 minutes more.
  </li>
  <li>
    Divide chicken among plates. Garnish with parsley.
